# Tech Summit 2019 - Introduction to React  

## Environment Set Up  
1. Install Git.  
    Read the instructions for your OS [by clicking this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).  
    **Note: If you want to configure Git after following the set up instructions at the link above, then click the "Next"  
    link at the bottom of the page. Configuring Git is not required for this workshop. We will only need the basic setup.**  
2. Install Node.  
    Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine.  
    Read the instructions for your OS [by clicking this link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and selecting your OS from the list.  
3. Optional: Install nvm.  
    You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to easily switch Node versions between different projects.  
    Installation instructions for nvm can be found [by clicking this link](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).  
    Installation instructions for nvm-windows can be found [by clicking this link](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).  
    **Note: This step is optional. If you have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 installed, nvm is not required. It is only  
    necessary if you need a different Node version installed on your machine for other projects.**
3. Install create-react-app.  
    `npm install -g create-react-app`
